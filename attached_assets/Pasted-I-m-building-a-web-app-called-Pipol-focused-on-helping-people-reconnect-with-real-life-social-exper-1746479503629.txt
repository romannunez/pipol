I'm building a web app called Pipol, focused on helping people reconnect with real-life social experiences through map-based event discovery and creation.

🌍 Purpose of the App:
The mission is to bring people back into meaningful real-world interactions. Pipol lets users:

Discover nearby in-person events (created by others)

Create events by choosing a location on a map

Join events and meet people with similar interests

Experience real life, not just virtual interactions

Think of it like a combination of Google Maps + Meetup + Pokémon Go, but the entire experience revolves around the interactive map and community-driven events.

🧱 Core Features (already planned/in development):
1. User Authentication
Users can sign up and log in using email (optionally with social login later).

Once logged in, users can:

Create events

Join events

View their created and joined events

2. Map View (Core UI)
Show current user location on the map

Load and display events from the database as pins/markers

Clicking a pin opens a detail popup/modal with:

Title

Description

Time/date

Price (if any)

Button to Join (or Pay + Join)

Map should support creating new events by tapping/long-pressing on a location

3. Create Event Flow
When a user selects a place on the map or taps “Create Event”:

A form is shown to enter:

Title

Description

Category (optional)

Date/time

Price (optional, can be $0)

When submitted, the event is saved to the database with user ID and location

4. Join Event Flow
If the event is free, users can join directly

If the event has a price, integrate Stripe to process payment

After payment, user is added to the attendees list

5. My Events
Show list of:

Events user created

Events user has joined

6. Admin/Moderation (future)
Events may need moderation or report/flag system (optional, not urgent)

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React or React Native (depending on mobile/web)

Map: Leaflet.js (preferred) or Mapbox

Backend: Node.js with Express.js (or Firebase Functions)

Database: Supabase (preferred) or Firebase Firestore

Auth: Supabase Auth (email/password)

Payments: Stripe

🚧 What I need help with now:
Please help build or improve the following parts of the app:

✅ Map Functionality:
Load current location

Fetch nearby events from Supabase and show as map markers

On marker click: show event info (popup/modal)

✅ Event Creation:
On map click: open event form modal with selected coordinates prefilled

Save event to Supabase with form data + location

✅ Event Join Flow:
If event has price > 0, trigger Stripe checkout before confirming join

Else, allow direct join (store user ID in attendees list)

✅ Event Details Component:
Show full event info

Button to Join / Pay & Join

Show number of attendees

✅ My Events Page:
Query and display events user has created or joined

Optional: Add categories or filters on the map (e.g. sports, music, business).

Organize files clearly, use functional components, and add comments where needed.

This version ensures Replit AI understands:

You’ve started the app and want to continue development

You’re using a real-time map interface

You have a backend and database preference

You need full event creation, discovery, and joining logic

Stripe integration is required for paid events
